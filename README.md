Homebrew Tap
=====================
This is a [Homebrew][brew] tap for software maintained by [SaveSecrets][savesecrets].

Setup
-----
Using these formulae requires [Homebrew][brew] to be installed.

Once homebrew is installed, simply run:
```
brew tap savesecrets/tap
```

Use
---
To install software, just use `brew install` with the name of the formula. You may have to run `brew update` first to get the latest version of the formulae.
For example, to install the latest version of [SLV][slv], run:
```
brew update
brew install slv
```
or to install [slv][slv] directly without setting up the homebrew tap, run:
```
brew install savesecrets/tap/slv
```
